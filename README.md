# WebRoom: A Virtual Learning Environment

The Webroom is a virtual space where students, staff and faculty have a place to meet and discuss ideas and topics in a synchronous environment. Users will be able to text chat and voice chat.

## Video Games for a Classroom?
Using modern video game technology, we are able to allow our students to gather in a virtual meeting space. It allows for virtual learning at any time and in any space.

## Who Should Use This?
Anyone can use it, from students who want to do group work and practice presentations to instructors who want to simulate or immerse their students in a virtual environment.

## Any Environment
The Center for eLearning and Connected Environments can not only design and create any environment you desire, we can create any scenario our faculty or staff can think of. If you need a virtual crime scene or a medical care facility for your nursing course, ask any one of us and we can get started.
